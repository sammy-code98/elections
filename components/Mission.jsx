            <p>
              Due process simply means strict compliance/adherence to and
              following established lay down rules/laws in getting things done
              which running of a government is among. Tell me a man who observes
              and respects rules and laws in his doings, and I&apos; ll show you
              a man who will respect your rights and accord you all your
              privileges. It&apos;s important to note that Engr. Chief Elias
              Mbam is a product of quality trainings in both civil and public
              service, and understands and appreciates the importance and the
              fact that governance becomes easier when leadership is in strict
              compliance to the rule of law, hence every public and civil
              servant in the state is sure to enjoy all his rights and
              privileges under his administration. As a product and a
              beneficiary of well structured strong institutions, Chief Mbam
              will restructure and reposition the civil service system for a
              better and effective service delivery to Ebonyi people. With Mbam,
              our rights shall be respected and privileges assuredly guaranteed.

              With every sense of modesty, Engr. Elias Mbam is one of the most
              experienced Ebonyian today most riped for governance and
              leadership, looking at the wealth of experience he had raked up to
              his credit from his years in civil service and as a public office
              holder of different exalted positions with tasking
              responsibilities. In all of the positions and his engagements in
              civil and public services, he has always distinguished himself in
              discharging every of his assigned duties. As a seasoned civil
              servant, he&apos;s a trained beurocrat and as a long serving public
              servant on the corridors of power, he&apos;s an excellent manager of
              both human and material resources. Anyone that combines the above
              two qualities will surely score A1 in practical leadership, and
              Ebonyians are blessed to have one in the person of Engr Chief
              Elias Mbam.
