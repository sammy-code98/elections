          <div className="collapse-content text-white">
            <p>
              Every principled man is always a man with good conscience, and a
              man of good conscience is always a man that has the fear of God.
              Any leader with the fear of God doesn&apos;t lead with a
              vindictive mindset, and when a leader doesn&apos;t lead with a
              vindictive mindset, all citizens irrespective of tribe, clan,
              kindred or political affiliation remain equal before the law and
              the government, and are treated with every respect and honor one
              deserves based on merit and not on where ones comes from or the
              political party he belongs to. Chief Elias Mbam is a well
              principled devoted Christian with the fear of God and good
              conscience. Under his administration, Ebonyi people will be
              treated equally, and social amenities distributed evenly. This can
              only be seen in an administration of a man of integrity with good
              conscience leading with the fear of God like Engr. Chief Mbam.

            <p>
              Every selfless person is always a non greedy person, and the
              greatest gift God will give to a people is a gift of a selfless
              person as a leader. A selfless leader doesn&apos;t personalize
              public property and fund, and wherever such a leader leads, the
              people rejoice and the land witnesses unprecedented development
              and progress. From his track records and pedigree, Chief Mbam is
              an outstanding selfless Nigerian. He may not be throwing money
              around, but he&apos;s definitely not in the class of those who
              steal billions from you and come back to throw few notes of naira
              at you. As a civil servant, Chairman of Boards, Commissioner,
              Minister and now the Chairman of RMAFC, he has always put the
              interest of the state ahead of his in all his undertakings. We
              need a man who will give to God what belongs to Him and to Caesar
              what belongs to him. In his administration, no Peter will be
              robbed to pay Paul, everyone will get his due as provided by the
              rules and laws of the state.

            <p>
              Engr. Chief Elias Mbam is a man that has established a robust
              relationship among the leaders and across all the clans in the
              State. From Ikwo Noyo, Ezza Ezekuna, Mgbolizhia, Igboesa, Ehugbo,
              Ohanivo etc, he has built bridges of friendship that will
              translate to bridges of more unity and understanding among the
              clans and people of Ebonyi state. In Izzi clan, he&apos;s one man
              that has evidently played down the kindred differences we are
              faced with and has demonstrated in practical actions his readiness
              to send such a devil induced difference to its early grave and
              untimely death. For the records and to substantiate the position
              above, Engr. Chief Mbam appointed an Igbojima his SA in his first
              tenure, and in this his second tenure he appointed an Unwuera his
              SA. Currently, he has given an Igbojima a sensitive appointment as
              his Chief Press Secretary. In all these, he has demonstrated
              clearly beyond any doubt that he&apos;ll treat all according to
              one&apos;s merit and not based on kindred, when this happens, the
              differences will surely die a natural death. Ebonyi needs a man of
              Engr Mbam&apos;s experience, pedigree and integrity come 2023.
