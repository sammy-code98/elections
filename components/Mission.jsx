              <li>A MAN OF DUE PROCESS:</li>
              <p>
                Due process simply means strict compliance/adherence to and
                following established lay down rules/laws in getting things done
                which running of a government is among. Tell me a man who
                observes and respects rules and laws in his doings, and I&apos; ll
                show you a man who will respect your rights and accord you all
                your privileges. It&apos; s important to note that Engr. Chief Elias
                Mbam is a product of quality trainings in both civil and public
                service, and understands and appreciates the importance and the
                fact that governance becomes easier when leadership is in strict
                compliance to the rule of law, hence every public and civil
                servant in the state is sure to enjoy all his rights and
                privileges under his administration. As a product and a
                beneficiary of well structured strong institutions, Chief Mbam
                will restructure and reposition the civil service system for a
                better and effective service delivery to Ebonyi people. With
                Mbam, our rights shall be respected and privileges assuredly
                guaranteed.
